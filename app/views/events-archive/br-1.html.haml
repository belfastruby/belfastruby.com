        %h3.what-icon.icon What?
        %p.description The first Belfast Ruby event will broach the topic of "Making the Jump to Ruby". Itâ€™s never an easy decision for a developer to change languages but most who move to Ruby and Rails never look back!
        %p.description This first meetup is a chance to talk to experienced Ruby developers and recent migrants about the differences between languages and their cultures, what makes Ruby so great, and how to get started.
        %p.description We'll also have a bar and some tasty snacks.
