        %p.description
          Tests are code too but we often don't treat them as such. This talk is about what I, Chris McGrath, have learned writing and maintaining tests for several apps over the years. I'm going to cover why we write tests, which tests to write, which tests not to write and tips for maintainable tests. I'm also hoping to learn some more tips from the audience!
