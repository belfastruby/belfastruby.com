intro: "The first Belfast Ruby event will broach the topic of making the jump to uby. Itâ€™s never an easy decision for a developer to change languages but most who move to Ruby and Rails never look back!"

---

This first meetup is a chance to talk to experienced Ruby developers and recent migrants about the differences between languages and their cultures, what makes Ruby so great, and how to get started.

We'll also have a bar and some tasty snacks.
