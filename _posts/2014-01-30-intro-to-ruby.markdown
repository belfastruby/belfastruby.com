###It’s our first Belfast Ruby event of the year so we hope to welcome back the regulars as well as plenty of new faces. We’ll be holding a few short talks focused on the theme of making the jump to Ruby and how to get started.

On 4th February we’ll be holding a few short talks about how you can get started with Ruby and how it compares to other programming langauges.

Bring your laptop and we’ll help you get set up, there will be snacks and drinks too!
