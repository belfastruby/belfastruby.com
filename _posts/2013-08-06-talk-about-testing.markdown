Chris McGrath (@chrismcg) has been a rubyist for almost ten years now (which is scary!). When not running, learning Aikido, or using conferences as an excuse to travel around the world he works as a developer for Kyero.com.

In his talk, Chris is going to cover why we write tests, which tests to write, which tests not to write and tips for maintainable tests. He's also hoping to learn some more tips from the audience!
