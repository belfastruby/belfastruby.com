[Barry Gordon](http://www.twitter.com/brrygrdn) from [ShopKeep](http://shopkeep.com) will be talking about TDD, discussing how you can use the principles in your Ruby development process. He'll be lending a helping hand during the workshops with getting set up with TDD/Ruby learning tool, Ruby Koans.

Following this, [Coby Chapple](http://twitter.com/cobyism) from [GitHub](http://github.com) will be demonstrating how to set up a free website using Jekyll, a ruby-based open source static site generator, and deploy it using GitHub Pages. Bring your laptop if you'd like help on getting your Jekyll sites up and running on the night.
